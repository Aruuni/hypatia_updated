# Extension ideas

The goal of `basic-sim` is to be a starting module to do ns-3 experiments in
networks. The following is a list of possible extensions, which should not be
part of `basic-sim`, but can be in a new module depending on `basic-sim`:

* Flowlet routing arbiter
* Long-living TCP application and scheduler
